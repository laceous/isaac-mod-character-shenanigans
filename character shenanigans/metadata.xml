    <description>This mod requires REPENTOGON. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you lock/unlock characters and their completion marks.

You can also import/export your completion marks. To import/export your unlocks/achievements and Eden Tokens, check out &quot;Stat and Achievement Shenanigans&quot;. Technically, that mod can also handle completion marks for built-in characters. It's just in a different format.

The import JSON uses this format for modded characters: &quot;M-{modId}-{playerName}&quot; or &quot;M-{modId}-{playerName}-Tainted-&quot;. If you remove &quot;M-&quot;, this is the same format you'll find in Repentogon's completionmarksX.json files which are located here: C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\Binding of Isaac Repentance\Repentogon

JSON values:
[list]
    [*]0 = Off
    [*]1 = Normal
    [*]2 = Hard
[/list]

This is a companion mod to:

[/list]

Modded characters are now supported. Hidden modded characters are accessible from the import/export tab.

Update: In an effort to tie achievements to completion marks, there's a new option to record your completion marks for any ending boss while in a run. Simply start a new run by selecting a character + difficulty, and use the options on the new Bosses tab. This will give you completion marks + any associated achievements (w/o having to go over to Stat and Achievement Shenanigans). Your mileage may vary with modded characters.</description>
